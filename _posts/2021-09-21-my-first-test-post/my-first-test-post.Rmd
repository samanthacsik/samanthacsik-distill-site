  I started putting together some presentation slides on the whys and hows of blogging using {distill} when I realized...maybe I've just found the content for my first blog post??

I am a total blog newb. 

*BUT* I'll soon be talking to our first Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) cohort (read more about this *awesome* new program [here](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science)) about why blogging as data scientists is important/valuable/a great learning experience and what a good blog post might look like. 

I originally set off on my self-education journey by digging into other data science-related blogs, and throwing together some slides about what I found. I even practiced creating a fake blog post on my own (and very much still under development) [personal website](samanthacsik.github.io) in case anyone asked me to walk them through the steps (I can't look like I don't know what I'm doing now, right??).

Ten slides deep and then it struck me -- I was creating a presentation on how to blog without ever *actually* creating my own blog post?? Dammit. Doesn't quite feel right. So here we are. Baby's first blog post *~about blog posts~*. I'd say this first post is half meant to serve our MEDS students as they embark on their fall quarter (and will surely be asked to blog every now and again, and maybe even feel the urge to do it just for fun) and half meant to be the catalyst I so desperately needed to finally put a little bit of writing out there in the data science world.

So here we go! I'll start by first sharing examples of different blogs that I believe demonstrate of some of the creative ways to format and publish data science content. Then I'll review some of the cool (and quite easy) things you can do with {distill} to create your own beautiful blog posts.

***Disclaimer:** A lot of the following content is just a compilation of excellent existing resources. I learn by repeating things (usually many times), so taking the time to type out code/YAML headers has been helpful, albeit not at all novel. See a list of all referenced resources at the bottom of this post.*

## Adding a `{distill}` blog to your personal website 

If you have not yet made a {distill} site, there are *many* great tutorials out there. For MEDS students, I recommend following along with these [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0SZiVvp32UTJ9sK_yVjI8ou6pVdFRXsY2236tiTA1c/edit) by [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/) before moving forward. For a very brief intro on customizing your {distill} site using CSS, check out these [slides](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-websites-css/#1).

Now that you have your {distill} site up and running, you can create your first blog post by running the `distill::create_post()` in your console:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
create_post(title = "My blog post")
```

If this is the **first time** you are creating a blog post, `distill` will add a directory called `_posts/`, which will contain this plus all future blog posts. You will also need to create a **listing page**, which will list all of your posts. Do this by adding a blank `.Rmd` file to your root directory by running `utils::file.edit("blog.Rmd")` in your console, then add a YAML header to your new file as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Blog"  # any name you want
listing: posts # do this exactly
---
```

Finally, link your new listing page to your website's navbar by editing `_site.yml`. *Note: Since I named by listing `.Rmd` file as `blog.Rmd`, the href I need to link to is `blog.html`.*

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
navbar:
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "Blog"      # add 
      href: blog.html   # add
```

## Customizing your `{distill}` blog & posts

A couple simple touches can go a long way in improving the look of your {distill} blog!

### Preview images

Preview images are those fun little thumbnails that appear alongside blog posts on your listing page:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("media/preview_img.png")
```

Add your image to the folder where your blog post `.Rmd` lives (e.g. `_posts` -> `YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post` -> `my_preview_image.jpeg`). Then, add the `preview` field to the YAML header of your blog post `.Rmd` file and set the value to the name of your preview image:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "my blog post"
# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)
preview: my_preview_image.jpeg  # your preview image
output:
  distill::distill_article:
    self_contained: false
---
```

### Categories

You can assign each post to one or more "categories," making it easier for your readers to filter content. Do so by adding the `categories` field to the YAML header of your blog post `.Rmd` file, then list whichever self-defined categories you would like your post to be assigned to. For example, I assigned this blog post to a `distill` category:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?"
# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)
categories:
  - distill # list as many categories as you'd like 
---
```

Take a look at your listing page to see all your categories (and how many articles are assigned to each). Assigned categories will also appear as metadata at the top of each post. 

### Table of contents

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "my blog post"
# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)
output:
  distill::distill_article:
    self_contained: false
    toc: true              # add a table of contents
    toc_float: true        # float it (positioned on the left-hand side, rather at the top)
---
```
