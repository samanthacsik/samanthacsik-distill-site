Dammit. Doesn’t quite feel right. So here we are. Baby’s first blog post ~about blog posts~. I’d say this first post is half meant to serve our MEDS students as they embark on their fall quarter (and will surely be asked to blog every now and again, and maybe even feel the urge to do it just for fun) and half meant to be the catalyst I so desperately needed to finally put a little bit of writing out there in the data science world.\nSo here we go! Let’s chat about some of the cool things you can do with {distill} to create really beautiful blog posts and take a look at some of the creative ways you can publish data science content.\nAdding a {distill} blog to your personal website\nIf you have not yet made a {distill} site, there are many great tutorials out there. For MEDS students, I recommend following along with these step-by-step instructions by Allison Horst before moving forward. For a very brief intro on customizing your {distill} site using CSS, check out these slides.\nNote: The following section was adapted from Alison Hill’s blog post, M-F-E-O: postcards + distill\nNow that you have your {distill} site up and running, you can create your first blog post by running the distill::create_post() in your console:\n\n\ncreate_post(title = \"My blog post\")\n\n\n\nIf this is the first time you are creating a blog post, distill will add a directory called _posts/, which will contain this plus all future blog posts. You will also need to create a listing page, which will list all of your posts. Do this by adding a blank .Rmd file to your root directory by running utils::file.edit(\"blog.Rmd\") in your console, then add a YAML header to your new file as follows:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Blog\"  # any name you want\nlisting: posts # do this exactly\n---\n\nFinally, add a link to your blog’s listing page in your navbar by editing _site.yml. NOTE: Since I named by listing .Rmd file as blog.Rmd, the href I need to link to is blog.html.\n\n\nnavbar:\n  right:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"Blog\"      # add \n      href: blog.html   # add\n\n\n\nCustomizing your {distill} blog & posts\nA couple simple touches can go a long way in improving the look of your {distill} blog! Most of this content has been adapted from Distill for R Markdown.\nPreview images\nPreview images are those…\n\n\n\nAdd the image you would like to use as your preview to the folder where your blog post .Rmd lives (e.g. _posts -> YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post -> my_preview_image.jpeg). Add the preview: field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file and set the value to the name of your preview image:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)\npreview: my_preview_image.jpeg # your preview image\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n---\n\nTable of contents\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n    toc: true              # add a table of contents\n    toc_float: true        # float it \n---\n\nCitation information\nYou can enable\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill/citations.html\nCategories\n\n\n\n",
