I even practiced creating a fake blog post on my own (and very much still under development) personal website in case anyone asked me to walk them through the steps (I can’t look like I don’t know what I’m doing now, right??).\nTen slides deep and then it struck me – I was creating a presentation on how to blog without ever actually creating my own blog post?? Dammit. Doesn’t quite feel right. So here we are. Baby’s first blog post ~about blog posts~. I’d say this first post is half meant to serve our MEDS students as they embark on their fall quarter (and will surely be asked to blog every now and again, and maybe even feel the urge to do it just for fun) and half meant to be the catalyst I so desperately needed to finally put a little bit of writing out there in the data science world.\nSo here we go! I’ll start by first sharing examples of different blogs that I believe demonstrate of some of the creative ways to format and publish data science content. Then I’ll review some of the cool (and quite easy) things you can do with {distill} to create your own beautiful blog posts.\nDisclaimer: A lot of the following content is just a compilation of excellent existing resources. I learn by repeating things (usually many times), so taking the time to type out code/YAML headers has been helpful, albeit not at all novel. See a list of all referenced resources at the bottom of this post.\nAdding a {distill} blog to your personal website\nIf you have not yet made a {distill} site, there are many great tutorials out there. For MEDS students, I recommend following along with these step-by-step instructions by Allison Horst before moving forward. For a very brief intro on customizing your {distill} site using CSS, check out these slides.\nNote: The following section was adapted from Alison Hill’s blog post, M-F-E-O: postcards + distill\nNow that you have your {distill} site up and running, you can create your first blog post by running the distill::create_post() in your console:\n\n\ncreate_post(title = \"My blog post\")\n\n\n\nIf this is the first time you are creating a blog post, distill will add a directory called _posts/, which will contain this plus all future blog posts. You will also need to create a listing page, which will list all of your posts. Do this by adding a blank .Rmd file to your root directory by running utils::file.edit(\"blog.Rmd\") in your console, then add a YAML header to your new file as follows:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Blog\"  # any name you want\nlisting: posts # do this exactly\n---\n\nFinally, link your new listing page to your website’s navbar by editing _site.yml. Note: Since I named by listing .Rmd file as blog.Rmd, the href I need to link to is blog.html.\n\n\nnavbar:\n  right:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"Blog\"      # add \n      href: blog.html   # add\n\n\n\nCustomizing your {distill} blog & posts\nA couple simple touches can go a long way in improving the look of your {distill} blog!\nNote: This section’s content was largely adapted from Distill for R Markdown.\nPreview images\nPreview images are those fun little thumbnails that appear alongside blog posts on your listing page:\n\n\n\nAdd your image to the folder where your blog post .Rmd lives (e.g. _posts -> YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post -> my_preview_image.jpeg). Then, add the preview field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file and set the value to the name of your preview image:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)\npreview: my_preview_image.jpeg  # your preview image\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n---\n\nCategories\nYou can assign each post to one or more “categories,” making it easier for your readers to filter content. Do so by adding the categories field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file, then list whichever self-defined categories you would like your post to be assigned to. For example, I assigned this blog post to a distill category:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)\ncategories:\n  - distill # list as many categories as you'd like \n---\n\nTake a look at your listing page to see all your categories (and how many articles are assigned to each). Assigned categories will also appear as metadata at the top of each post.\nTable of contents\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n    toc: true              # add a table of contents\n    toc_float: true        # float it (positioned on the left-hand side, rather at the top)\n---\n\nCitation information\nYou can enable\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill/citations.html\nReferences\nHill (2020, Dec. 22), M-F-E-O: postcards + distill.
