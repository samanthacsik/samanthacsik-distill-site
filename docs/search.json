I’m the Data Training Coordinator at the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS) located at UC Santa Barbara, where I’m working to develop and teach data science training curricula for the Master’s of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program and other data science initiatives across NCEAS and UCSB. I am also a co-organizer of R-Ladies Santa Barbara, a local data science group which works to promote diversity in the R community. In my spare time, you’ll typically find me hiking with my pup or cooking family dinners with friends.\n            \n            \n            Education\n            MA in Ecology, Evolution & Marine Biology, 2020 – University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA\n            BSc in Marine Biology, 2016 – Northeastern University, Boston, MA\n            \n            \n            Experience\n            Data Training Coordinator (2021-present) - National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA\n            Data Science Fellow (2020-2021) - National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Samantha Csik\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                       LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                       Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                       GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                       Email\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Hi there!\n              I’m Sam (and my last name is pronounced “chick”).
