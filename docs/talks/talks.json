However, in\norder for synthesis science to be possible, data need to be documented\nand stored in a way that makes them both discoverable and interpretable\nby researchers. My team at NCEAS is taking a semantic approach to\ncurating environmental datasets – we develop controlled vocabularies, or\nontologies, that we use to annotate data records. This helps to both (a)\nincrease our understanding of the terms researchers have used to\ndescribe their data by providing greater meaning and context, and (b)\nincreases the precision of our online data searches so that we more\nconfidently recover all available and relevant datasets.\n\n\n\n",
