# Overview

My *very first time* (co)leading an R-based live-coding workshop(!) and the experience that got me hooked on teaching RStats/data science ❤️, given to [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/).

# Abstract 

In this live-coding workshop, we teach useful functions for data tidying, wrangling and visualization using tidyverse packages & functions (e.g. `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `forcats`, etc.). This session is intended for R users at any level, whether it's your first time exploring the tidyverse or if you're refreshing your wrangling skills!
