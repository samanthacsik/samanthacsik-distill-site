I'm slowly trying to add a bit more about who I am outside of work. More to come soon!

I feel very fortunate to be doing so many of things that I love *a lot* right now. That includes my job, but also spending lots of time outdoors. Living in Santa Barbara is a massive privilege and being here means that we have access to both the mountains and the sea, each a few minutes in either direction. It was the ocean that brought me here originally, but most of my free time is now spent on the trails. 

I started recording my hikes on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) in late 2020 and finally got around to scraping my activity data using the [`rStrava`](https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava) package. Below is a heat map of all my recorded hikes made using [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/). I'm still mulling over a better way to display activity information, as the markers overlap a lot at my most frequented trail heads. Huge shout out to [Daniel Cullen]() (who also happens to be a Santa Barbara resident!) for his awesome [blogpost](https://www.dancullen.me/articles/creating-a-heatmap-in-r-with-google-polylines) that got me started with my own map.
