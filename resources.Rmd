*Currently under development* 

It's finally time for an upgraded notebook! I've been Slacking myself (and subsequently burying) links to resources for far too long, so my favorites will now live here. 

## R tools

## Data Viz

## Open Data Science

## Data Science Communities

* [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/) and [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/) which work to promote gender diversity in the R community
* [EcoDataScience](https://eco-data-science.github.io/), an environmental data science study group at UCSB
* [Southern California R Users](https://socalr.org/), an alliance of R user groups in Southern California
* [Santa Barbara Women in STEM](https://www.sbwomeninstem.org/), while not specifically data science-focused, this group holds some really great career and networking events, panels, flash talks, and more

## Web Accessibility

* [The A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) is a community-driven effort to make digital content more accessible. I still have a long way to go in making my own website [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) compliant -- the A11Y Project not only has a ton of great blog posts, but also WCAG compliance checklist that I will definitely be returning to over and over again.
* [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/), a color blindness simulator -- just upload a file and view your color palettes as they would appear under different types of color deficiencies
